## Overview
KrigMapPro is an geostatistical analysis tool designed to do the modeling and visualisation of spatial data through Kriging. This tool is for mapping radioactivity concentrations across geographical regions using UTM coordinates. It has an easy-to-use graphical user interface, which allows you to adjust variogram and Kriging parameters dynamically without delving deeply into code.

## Features
- **Variogram Modeling**: Configure and customise the variogram model parameters to fit the spatial structure of your data.
- **Kriging Estimation**: Perform Kriging to predict and interpolate unknown values based on the spatial correlation described by the variogram.
- **Interactive Maps**: View the Krige plot on top of satellite maps.
- **Flexible Data Handling**: Easily import and manage your spatial data using the GUI.
- **Plotting**: Generate and customise plots directly within the application to visualise data and analysis results.

# Getting Started with KrigMapPro
- Download the KrigMapPro.exe at this Google Drive link (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SA7lob7Ze1RGNh5xXkaAQ8VlvlmsQwzX/view?usp=drive_link)
- Unzip the .zip file and run the .exe file. You may get a Windows Defender popup saying the .exe file is not safe. Ignore this and run the .exe.
